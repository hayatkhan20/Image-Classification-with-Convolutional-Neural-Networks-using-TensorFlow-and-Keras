# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.

## Overview

The code demonstrates the following key components:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - Utilizes `ImageDataGenerator` for real-time data augmentation and normalization.
   - Loads and organizes image data into training and testing sets.

2. Model Architecture:
   - Defines a CNN model using the Sequential API.
   - Architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers.

3. Model Training:
   - Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the metric.
   - Trains the model using the `fit_generator` method.

4. Visualization:
   - Plots training and testing loss and accuracy over epochs.
   - Generates a visual representation of the model architecture.

5. Prediction on New Images:
   - Demonstrates how the trained model can make predictions on new, unseen images.
